      ## Rationale
      # Architecture Rationale

## Chosen Cloud-Native Patterns and Components
- **Microservices Architecture**: Transitioning from a monolithic system to microservices allows for independent scaling, development, and deployment of services.
- **API Gateway**: To create a modular interface for the application, allowing for easy integration with external services and modern applications.
- **Load Balancing**: To distribute incoming traffic effectively and enhance the availability of services.
- **Database as a Service (RDS)**: Using AWS RDS for Oracle brings reliability, scalability, and automated management of the database.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Integration with AWS CloudWatch for observability into the applicationâ€™s performance and health.

## Technology Decisions and Justification
- Migration to AWS for cloud infrastructure provides scalability, flexibility, and compliance capabilities essential for the finance sector.
- Adoption of DevOps practices and CI/CD using GitHub Actions enhances feature delivery speed and reduces the operational risk associated with manual deployments.

## Benefits
- **Scalability**: Microservices can be scaled independently based on demand, improving performance during peak hours.
- **Cost**: Reduced maintenance costs by eliminating the need for specialized COBOL skills and outdated infrastructure.
- **Security**: Better security practices through IAM roles and security groups following the principle of least privilege.
- **Resilience**: Increased resilience through the use of managed services with built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms.

## Industry and Environment Context
This architecture aligns with the finance industry's need for reliable, secure, and compliant solutions that can adapt to evolving customer demands while maintaining regulatory standards.

      # Architectural Decision Record

## Problem(s) to Solve
The company faces significant limitations due to its monolithic legacy application. Key issues include performance bottlenecks, high maintenance costs, lack of modern observability, difficulty integrating newer technologies, and the on-premises infrastructure restricting scalability and compliance.

## Analysis Performed
A review of cloud-native patterns indicates that microservices architecture, API gateways, and managed services can significantly alleviate the pain points experienced in the current monolithic architecture. AWS was chosen for its robust offerings tailored for financial services.

## Decision and Justification
The decision to transition to a cloud-native architecture on AWS utilizing microservices was made to enhance scalability, improve performance, and reduce operational costs. This approach allows for faster feature delivery and better compliance with industry regulations.
